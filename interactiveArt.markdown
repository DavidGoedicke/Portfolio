### Interactives
Over the years, I've collaborated on creating interactive art pieces, from physical installations like to digital video works to creating reactive theater stages.


### Music
I began playing drums at age five and composing at 17. I performed in various bands and orchestras until I completed my Master's degree. Nowadays, I focus on composing solo pieces, mainly using software like LogicPro, Cubase, and Ableton. I collaborate on many video projects with [Emiel Harmsen](https://emielharmsen.com), providing the music, and have aspirations to venture into live music production/coding/DJing. 
I maintain a somewhat updated [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/davidgoedi) and occasionally stream live music on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@makingmusicwithfriendssome4015).

 I love exploring new expressive tools for music and visuals. In this example, I used [IANNIX](https://www.iannix.org/en/), Max 7, and LogicPro to create the audio track for a 360 VR video.

### Photos
Like many, I enjoy photography. A curated selection of my work is available on Flickr.
