# Welcome

I am David Goedicke, a researcher and innovator dedicated to advancing our understanding of human-technology interactions. My work focuses on developing immersive experiences and innovative prototypes to explore future technologies and their impact on society.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where I collaborate with the [Human-Computer Interaction](https://hci.informatik.uni-due.de) under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Stefan Schneega√ü. My research specializes in utilizing VR/XR simulators and qualitative behavioral methods to investigate complex interactions between users, robots, and simulated agents in virtual and augmented environments.

With a strong foundation in interactive art, game development, and music, I strive to enrich the qualitative depth of technological interactions, particularly in the domains of human-robot interaction and automated systems. My academic journey includes a Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell Tech and an M.Sc. in Human Media Interaction from the University of Twente.

Additionally, you can listen to my [music productions]({% link interactiveArt.markdown %}/#Sound-Cloud) that reflect my interdisciplinary approach to technology and creativity.
